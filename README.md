# Spanner
A set of tools, components, and editor extensions for game development in Unity.

# Importing the latest updates into your Unity project
1. Download the latest [Spanner.unitypackage](https://github.com/MandalaGames/Spanner/blob/master/UnityPackages/Spanner.unitypackage) file from the master branch and save it wherever you like
2. Open your Unity project, right click anywhere in your Assets folder, and click "Import Package -> Custom" (you don't have to delete the old folder, if you're using an older version)
3. Navigate to the package file you downloaded in step 1 and select it.
4. All done! You should now be able to use our latest code in your project! It should all live under Assets/Spanner.
